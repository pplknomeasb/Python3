# Python3
Will be taking on a Python 3 course created by stakskills.com.  

Upload one.  Learned how to use Python's IDE.  If one isn't capable of using the IDE, one is capable of using any notepad type program.  The file itself has to be saved in a .py format in order for Python to correctly execute the program.  For now, to run the program I open the cmd line and execute 'python D:\Python3\fileName.py' and the program within the file will run.  If any part of your directory has open spaces in the file's name or the program name, the file name has to be in double quotes like so; "D:\Python3\fileName.py".

Upload userInput.  The reason behind a program is to execute commands in order to give the end user a specific set of results.  The userInput program displays a command to the user to input a specif string.  The string set that the user inputs is stored in a variable named user_says.  Once the operation is executed, the variable user_says is called once more using the print operation and the string data is printed on the command line.

Upload variableDeclarations.  Declaring variables types in Python is done behind the scenes of Python.  my_var = 10; my_var becomes an integar type.  my_var = "hello"; my_var becomes a string type.  my_var = True; my_var becomes a boolean type.  a = b = c = 10; a, b, and c are all integar variables with a value of 10.  a, b, c = 1, 2, 3; a = 1 b = 2 c = 3.  The value's declared to the variables are stored within the program and will have a value reference to ensure speed.

#strings, numbers, booleans, lists, sets frozensets, tuples, ranges, dictionaries, none are built in datatypes
#mutability = can be modified after creation
#immutability = cannot be modified after creation


Chapter Strings
Formatting the output is crucial for communicating the information that is wanted by the end user.  The output that is generated can at times include information that isn't necessary to display everything, we have to utilize the mothods and operators in order display only what is appropriate to the user.  In the chapter of strings, we learned indexing rules, formatting upper and lowercase strings, deliminaters, strip, replace, split, join, and splicing.
