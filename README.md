# Python3
Will be taking on a Python 3 course created by stakskills.com.  

Upload one.  Learned how to use Python's IDE.  If one isn't capable of using the IDE, one is capable of using any notepad type program.  The file itself has to be saved in a .py format in order for Python to correctly execute the program.  For now, to run the program I open the cmd line and execute 'python D:\Python3\fileName.py' and the program within the file will run.  If any part of your directory has open spaces in the file's name or the program name, the file name has to be in double quotes like so; "D:\Python3\fileName.py".
